                                        Arduino script examples to verify the functionlity of the Artemis board. In Part II, by introudcing Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE), the Artemis board
                                        was able to establish a communication channel with the computer including sending, receving information. Jupyter Notebook was operated 
                                        on the pc end and Arduino code was operated on the Artemis board end. The board advertised the MAC address and Universal Uniqle Identified(uuid) to
                                        make the connection with the computer.

                                   <p class = "modal-body text-left">Infrared light, being invisible, permeates our daily environment and can significantly influence infrared sensors. Thus, when designing such sensors, it is imperative to select a specific wavelength of infrared light to minimize interference. Moreover, it is advisable to avoid deploying these sensors in areas with strong light sources. The TOF sensor, particularly, tends to exhibit superior performance under low-light conditions.

                                    In the experimentation conducted with various reflective surfaces, minimal impact on the sensor's results was observed irrespective of the color of the surface. While darker objects theoretically absorb more light and should produce less return energy, this effect was not evident in practice. Notably, the sensor demonstrated the ability to penetrate glass-like surfaces, enabling measurement of the distance to objects situated behind the glass, which is undesirable. This issue may be less prevalent with ultrasonic distance sensors due to the differing properties of electromagnetic and mechanical waves.</p>

                                    <p class="modal-body text-left">The goal of this lab was to integrate two dual motor drivers to the Artemis and connect dc motors to implement the open loop control of the robot. 
                                        The motors were triggered by PWM signals to control the motion.

                                based on the designed connections. As discussed in the lecture, by shorting the four pairs of pin: BIN1 and AIN2, BIN2 and AIN2, BOUT1 and AOUT2, BOUT2 and AOUT2
                                , the artemis was able to utilize two pins to conect the motor driver and control the motor, also increased the current two times greater than the original design. All the input pins 
                                were soldered to the Artemis board using pin 13, 12, 6, and 7. According to the datasheet of Artemis nano, except pin 8 and 10, other I/O pins are capable to generate PWM signals.
                                In order to create the bridge between pin pairs, several short length wires were soldered to connect them together. Following the diagram, the motor battery was connected to the GND and VIN pins for both 
                                motor drivers in series. </p>

                                The motors have relatively greater power draw from the battery. The second battery powering the Artemis can maintain the remote controllability of the robot. The design 
                                seperates the control module and acturator module to avoid unexpected Artemis shutdown due to battery poewr depletion. </p>

                                    . In order to implement the verification, the motor driver was powered by an external power supply with the 3.7V output, which is the same voltage output as the battery. The ground pin was hooked with the power supply ground cable.
                                    The input pin from the motor driver was connected to the oscilloscope. The PWM generation code was uploaded to the Artemis board. It initalized the GPIO values with the corresponding soldered pins.
                                    The analogWrite() function generated a PWM signal from the board to the motor driver. The duty cycle was set to 127/255, which provided an average of 50% output voltage. By verifing the wave form from
                                    the oscilloscope, there was half of the time the voltage was set to high. Therefore, the PWM signal matched the expected value.

                                    speed was determined by the duty cycle. The value was set to 100 and the motor was spining relatively fast. The video demonstrated the motor was able to rotate in two directions properly.

                                <p class = "modal-body text-left">The calibration process was conducted firstly by driving the robot in straight line for roughtly 2 feet. Due to nature of torque difference between
                                     two motors, the same PWM value did not generate the same torque. Therefore, when both PWM pins were set to 100, the robot behaved to turn right. Based on this observation, the right motor 
                                     generated larger torque than the left motor. The left motor PWM value was added 10 for the first three experiments. The right-turning trend had reduced. The PWM increment was changed to 5 for each 
                                     experiment. The left PWM value was set to 150 in the end, which was capable to provide similar torque as the right motor. The ratio of left motor PWM and the right motor PWM was set to 1.5. According to the video,
                                     the robot was driving a straight line for around 9 bricks, which is roughly 270cm. Thus, the calibration met the straight line requirements.

The estimation was based on the principle of linear estimation. The predicted point was calcualted by the slope and the corresponding time step using previous measurement data. The process increased the amount of data remarkably. 
                                        The control system could adjust its outputs based on estimated current distances rather than waiting for the next sensor update. This can make the system more responsive to changes.

                    <p class = "text-center">This course focuses on systems level design and implementation of dynamic autonomous robots. We will design a fast autonomous car and explore dynamic behaviors, acting forces, sensors, and reactive control on an embedded processor, as well as the benefit of partial off-board computation, 
                        low latency software, and noise tolerant implementation.</h5>
